                Nearly half of Earth's known species live in forests, including nearly 80% of biodiversity on land. That variety is especially rich in tropical rainforests, but forests teem with life around the planet: Insects and worms work nutrients into soil, bees and birds spread pollen and seeds, and keystone species like wolves and big cats keep hungry herbivores in check. Biodiversity is a big deal, both for ecosystems and human economies, yet it's increasingly threatened around the world by deforestation.

Forests are critical in regulating the Earth's climate. They store large amounts of carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis and are thus carbon sinks.

                Logging and wood harvesting are among the leading causes of deforestation across the world, especially in North America and Russia. Forests are valuable resources that provide timber products for construction, furniture, and paper. Unfortunately, this often leads to unsustainable logging practices that destroy millions of hectares of forested land every year.

                Subsistence farming is common in many countries, and it is often the only way for millions of people to sustain their families. Farmers in these areas typically clear small plots of land by cutting down trees and burning them. Unfortunately, this practice is usually unsustainable, as farmers are forced to clear a larger land surface when the soil becomes infertile. Commercial agriculture, on the other hand, involves clearing vast areas of forest to make way for large-scale production of cash crops like soy and palm oil.

                Urbanisation and the expansion of cities have a significant impact on deforestation, contributing to the destruction of forested land across the globe. As urban areas grow, they require more resources to sustain their populations, increasing demand for products like beef and agricultural goods. This demand fuels deforestation both directly—through the conversion of forested land into housing or agricultural land—and indirectly—by increasing pressure on forests to provide resources.

                Fires are a natural and beneficial element of many forest landscapes, but they are problematic when they occur in the wrong place, at the wrong frequency, or at the wrong severity. Climate change and wildfires also mutually reinforce each other, and the fires burning today in much of the world are bigger, more intense, and longer lasting than before. Each year, millions of acres of forest are destroyed or degraded by fire.
